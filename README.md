### Prime Number and Bktree implementation
Here , I have created two classes to implement both algorithm.
For prime Number, I have created two input box which take lower and upper range.

And implemented a simple Bktree whose input I used is already saved in array.

Run this module from www/html folder in linux and any folder name.
This will show you its desired output.
